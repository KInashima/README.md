Sprint 4: SDA US SUV Vehicles Analysis

The vehicles_us.csv data is processed, and an interactive web app is created which represents some analysis of the data.

The projects process with the vehicles_us.csv data, is further described and noted through the EDA.ipynb in the notebook. The file in the data is processed so that it can be ran through the streamlit so an interactive selectbox, graph, and text are created in a web app. The projects process, are saved through github. Then through render, a web app is deployed, which can be accessed through the URL located below. 

The web app can be previewed through the terminal via streamlit run app.py.
