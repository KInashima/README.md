Sprint 4: SDA US SUV Vehicles Analysis

The vehicles_us.csv data is processed, and an interactive web app is created which represents some analysis of the data.

The projects process with the vehicles_us.csv data, is further described and noted through the EDA.ipynb in the notebook. The file in the data is processed so that it can be ran through the streamlit so an interactive selectbox, graph, and text are created in a web app. The projects process, are saved through github. Then through render, a web app is deployed, which can be accessed through the URL located below. 

The web app can be previewed through the terminal via streamlit run app.py.

Checkbox is created. 

For the filling in the missing data, as a scientist in good concious cannot do that, that is an unethical practice, that can ulter the data alot. You shouldn't by presumption fill in missing data via their mode or median especially when multiple variable contributes to the data. In all the years worked in research, I have never filled in missing data so that I can have the n value met. 

Would you also please clarify by your idea of optimization. Because to fill in data via mode and median is not optimization, because it doesnt alter how the data is processed, but changes quantity of the n value.

I am hoping my final edition to be accept with my explanation please.
